As a brand new baby, the strawberries possess white leaves and a yellow center (AKA a flower)
  Use two HSV masks (for white and green) then or them together into a single mask
  
After 1 week, whiteish green with smaller green leaves

After 2 weeks, Whitish green with more mature green leaves

After 2 weeks 4 days, berry is mature (red)

Cycle is green->white->red

Might also consider a mask that masks white and red to identify strawberries that are in between maturing stages
